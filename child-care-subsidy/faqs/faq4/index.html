<p>Licensed and License Exempt providers who want to receive subsidies to provide child care for eligible families need to ask the children’s parents to designate them as the provider using this <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mikidsmatter/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/ogs/cdc-2/provider_docs/dhs4025_provider_verification_pk_4-8-15_ada.pdf?rev=f693d61aaa6944708b394a8526b84a36&amp;hash=E82C6E7FF267145B52344E9F2091D45F">form</a>. The parent must then submit the form to MDHHS. Licensed providers will then receive the subsidy payment directly from the state.</p>
<p>All providers receiving a subsidy payment will use the State’s <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mde/services/early-learners-and-care/cdc/providers/resources/provider-i-billing">I-Billing portal</a> to complete billings every two weeks and to receive payment from Michigan Department of Education. Step-by-step instructions explaining how to use the I-Billing system can be found in the <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mde/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/ogs/cdc-2/provider_docs/cdc_handbook.pdf?rev=ca94b918cd0540af85ac36a175d982c1&amp;hash=D2489C23BA5D23E5FBD9309DD8D6B119">Child Development and Care Handbook</a>. All licensed providers must also be registered with SIGMA Vendor Self Service (VSS) to receive CDC subsidy payments. More information on how to register to receive subsidy payments from the state of Michigan can be found <a href="https://sigma.michigan.gov/webapp/PRDVSS2X1/AltSelfService">here</a>.</p>
