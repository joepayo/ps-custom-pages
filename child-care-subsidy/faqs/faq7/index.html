<p>Many parents can get the CDC subsidy to help them pay for child care. To be eligible for the subsidy, a parent must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a child under 13, or a child up to  18 who has special needs,</li>
<li>Need child care because they are going to work, attending an approved education or training program (including working on a GED or bachelor’s degree), or participating in an approved counseling or treatment program, and</li>
<li>Have a qualifying income. Parents can use the State's <a href="https://greatstarttoquality.org/ineligible-subsidy-submission/">eligibility calculator</a> to see if they are eligible.</li>
</ul>
<p>They can also visit the <a href="https://newmibridges.michigan.gov/s/isd-landing-page?language=en_US">MI Bridges</a> site to see if they are eligible for other sources of support, in addition to the child care subsidy.</p>
