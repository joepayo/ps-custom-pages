<p>Licensed child care centers, licensed group homes, and licensed family homes receive payments directly from the state to the provider in the provider’s name.</p>
<p>State payments for care provided by a License Exempt provider are issued from the state directly to the parent in the parent’s name. The parent then pays the child care provider directly.</p>
<p>Some families have a Family Contribution amount that they must pay as a portion of their total child care costs. The amount depends on family size, income and other eligibility factors. The family must pay the Family Contribution amount to the child care provider directly. This applies to both Licensed and License Exempt providers. Family Contributions are temporarily waived for all families, regardless of provider type or rating, until 9/23/2023.</p>
