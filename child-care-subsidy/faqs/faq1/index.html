<p>No. You do not have to be a licensed child care provider to be paid by the state, but this does make it easier. With a license you can provide care for more children, you will receive payments directly from the state, you will be paid at a higher rate, and the children you care for do not have to be siblings. If you are interested in getting a child care license, you can start <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/lara/bureau-list/cclb">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not have a license, you are still eligible to receive subsidy payments as a &quot;License Exempt&quot; provider, sometimes referred to as &quot;family, friend or neighbor&quot; care. There are two categories of License Exempt providers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>License Exempt-Related providers - These are providers who are at least 18 years old and <strong>are related</strong> to the children as a grandparent, aunt, or uncle (including great aunt/uncle) or as a sibling (who does not live in the home with the children). These providers can provide care for between one and six children, and can provide care in the provider's home or the children's home. The children cared for must all be siblings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>License Exempt-Unrelated providers - These are providers who are at least 18 years old and are <strong>not related</strong> to the child as a grandparent, aunt, uncle, or sibling. License Exempt-Unrelated providers must provide care in the child's home. The children cared for must all be siblings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike licensed providers, License Exempt child care providers do not receive subsidy payments from the State of Michigan. The Michigan Department of Education will provide these subsidy payments directly to families, which they then provide to you.</p>
<p>License Exempt providers must be 18 years old, complete a background check, and complete some provider training classes.
