<p>The amount you are paid for each child depends on a few factors, including the children’s ages, the number of hours they are approved for,  whether you are licensed, your organization’s star rating or training level, and how much the state believes the children’s families can contribute (and therefore pay you directly). You can find more information about payment rates in the <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mikidsmatter/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/ogs/cdc-2/provider_docs/cdc_handbook.pdf?rev=3a046b232602404099b0a30cc4430f26&amp;hash=109BE5DFE56F31646564508398A842D7">CDC Handbook</a>.
