        <p class="text-2xl leading-tight">In 2021, the expanded Child Tax Credit was worth $3,000 per child ages 6-17 and $3,600 per child under 6. While that version of the Child Tax Credit expired after one year, Congress is considering a bill that would increase the tax credit amount and expand eligibility over the 2023, 2024, and 2025 tax years.
 <br><br>In the meantime, you can still benefit from existing tax programs designed to help families. Single parents making up to $200,000 annually and married couples making up to $400,000 annually can receive as much as $1,600 per child from the Child Tax Credit, depending on income level.<br><br>If you have children under 18 who live with you more than half of the year, you are likely eligible even if you do not usually file taxes or have low/no earnings.
