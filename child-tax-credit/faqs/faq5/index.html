<p>The expanded Child Tax Credit increases the maximum credit a family can receive from $2,000 per child per year to $3,000 per child, increasing to $3,600 for children under six. This means that if you have two children, aged 4 and 7, your credit will be worth $6,600 for the year. The overall credit is divided into monthly payments, so you can expect $250 per month for each child between 6 and 17, and $300 per month for each child under 6.</p>
