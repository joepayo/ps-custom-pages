<p>It is highly unlikely. It is possible, if your income fluctuated from 2020 to 2021 (and your 2021 income moves you outside the eligible range for the expanded advanced credit) that you could receive larger monthly payments than you are eligible for. However, because these partial payments are only distributed for part of 2021, your overall advanced credit will not exceed the total you are eligible for, and you will simply receive a smaller lump sum credit when you file your 2021 taxes.</p>
<p>Also, if you receive payments for a child who is no longer a dependent, you may have to pay that money back, though there are some protections in place for those with incomes below $80,000 (for individuals), $100,000 (for single, head-of-household), or $120,000 (for filing jointly).</p>
<p>Finally, if your income fluctuated so much that your 2021 income made you ineligible for the Child Tax Credit at all, you would have to pay the money back, but these thresholds are quite high ($200,000 for an individual and $400,000 for a joint return).</p>
<p>If the expanded Child Tax Credit becomes a permanent part of the tax code, there could be a scenario in which an income swing from year to year could mean you would receive a larger advanced credit than you are eligible for, causing you to pay back some of the credit.</p>
