<p>The payment amounts are all slightly different:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the first stimulus payment (issued in March of 2020), eligible individuals should have received $1,200 ($2,400 if married and filing jointly), with an additional $500 for every dependent under 17.</li>
<li>For the second stimulus payment, households that meet the income requirement should have received $600 for every adult and dependent child under 17.</li>
<li>For the third stimulus payment, eligible individuals will receive $1,400 ($2,800 if married and filing jointly), plus $1,400 for each claimed dependent, including those that are 17 and over (e.g., college students who are still claimed as dependents, as well as older adults who may live with you and are claimed as dependents).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the size of the check and expanded eligibility for dependents, the biggest difference with the third payment is the eligibility for partial payments. For the first two checks income eligibility for partial payments extended well above $75,000, but for the third payments, adults earning more than $80,000 (or married couples earning more than $160,000) will not receive checks.</p>
