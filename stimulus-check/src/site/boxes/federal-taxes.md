title: If you haven’t filed taxes or have no income
text: If you haven’t filed federal taxes (for 2018 or 2019) you need to file a simple tax return as soon as possible. Even if you have no income, you still need to file taxes to receive your stimulus payment. You can file taxes online for free through <a href='https://turbotax.intuit.com/stimulus-check/?PID=100024933&SID=35871X943606Xb63b93f519d1ba0fca28d995185ff190&cid=all_cjtto-100024933_int&ref_id=806a7b40780e11ea832804a50a240613_454205118580443733%3AtDqLMypBH0UV'>TurboTax</a>.
