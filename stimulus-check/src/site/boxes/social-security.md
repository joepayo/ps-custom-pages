title: If you receive Social Security benefits
text: If you receive Social Security benefits and have no dependents, you don’t need to file a tax return. Your stimulus payment will be automatically deposited into the same account as your social security payments. If you have dependents you may need to file a tax return. Social Security is not the same as SSI. If you receive SSI, you will need to file a tax return to receive your stimulus payment.

You can file a federal tax return for free online:
* If you receive Social Security benefits and have dependent(s), you should file a tax return to ensure you receive a $500 credit (the Social Security Administration does not have information on dependents).
* If you receive SSI, but not Social Security, you will need to file a tax return to receive your stimulus payment.
