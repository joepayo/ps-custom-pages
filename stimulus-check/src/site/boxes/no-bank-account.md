title: If you don’t have a bank account or prepaid debit card
text: It could take up to five months to receive your stimulus check by mail. To get your stimulus payment quickly through direct deposit, sign up for a bank account online and add your account information on the IRS website. If you don’t want to sign up for a bank account, you can link your prepaid debit card instead.
