faq_title: Stimulus Check FAQs
faq_text: Here are some answers to common questions and concerns
faqs:
  - question: Am I eligible to receive a stimulus check?
    answer: "Over 80% of Michigan residents are eligible for the coronavirus stimulus payment. To qualify for the full payment, you must make below $75,000 per year ($150,00 for a married couple). <br><br>
You don't have to be a U.S. citizen to get a payment, but you do need a valid Social Security number. That means immigrants with green cards and people on H-1B and H-2A visas will get payments. Non-resident aliens, temporary workers, and illegal immigrants won't receive payments.<br><br> 
Here’s a <a href='https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/falling-through-cracks-many-americans-won-t-get-coronavirus-checks-n1177266'>list</a> of the people who aren’t eligible."

  - question: How much money will I get?
    answer: "If you qualify for the stimulus payment, you’ll receive $1,200 for yourself ($2,400 if married). You’ll receive an additional $500 for every dependent child under the age of 17.<br>
For example, an eligible single parent with two children will receive $2,200. An eligible married couple with two children will receive $3,400."

  - question: When will I receive my check?
    answer: "Stimulus payments will arrive in bank accounts through direct deposit starting on April 9th, 2020. If you don't have a bank account, expect delays – it could take up to five months to receive your check by mail."
    id: faq-3
  - question: Will the stimulus check affect my other government benefits?
    answer: "The stimulus checks are treated as a tax credit. This means your payment will not impact the benefits you receive now or in the future. For example, the stimulus payment won’t impact your food stamps, healthcare, earned income tax credit, or unemployment benefits."
    id: faq-4
  - question: Do I need a bank account to get my stimulus payment?
    answer: "The primary way the federal government is sending stimulus payments is by depositing money directly into people’s bank accounts. If you don’t have a bank account, the government will mail you a check. Expect delays if you don’t have a bank account – it could take up to five months to receive your check by mail."
    id: faq-5
  - question: Will I get the stimulus payment if I haven’t filed taxes?
    answer: "You must file taxes to receive a stimulus check, unless you are receiving Social Security benefits. If you don’t normally file taxes (or haven’t filed taxes for 2018 or 2019) you need to file a simple federal income tax return as soon as possible."

  - question: What if I don’t qualify - where else can I get help?
    answer: "If you don’t qualify for the stimulus payment, we recommend reaching out to Michigan 2-1-1. They can connect you to resources in your community."
