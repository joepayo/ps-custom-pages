<p>If you did not get the full amount of the third stimulus payment, you might be eligible for the Recovery Rebate Credit. To be qualified for the Recovery Rebate Credit, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earn less than $75,000 per year if you are single, $112,500 if you’re the head of household (typically single parents), or $150,000 for a married couple filing jointly.</li>
<li>Have a valid Social Security number, or file taxes with a spouse or dependent with a valid SSN.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get the Recovery Rebate Credit by <strong>filing your 2021 taxes</strong>– even if you don’t usually file taxes. If you live in Wayne, Macomb, or Oakland counties and earn under $60,000 per year, visit GetTheTaxFacts.org to schedule an appointment with trusted tax experts at no cost.</p>
