        <div class="invisible h-0 text-2xl opacity-0 answer markdown max-h-0"><p><strong>The vast majority of Michigan residents are eligible</strong> for the coronavirus stimulus payment.
<br><br>
<strong>To qualify for the full payment,</strong> you must make less than $75,000 per year ($150,000 for a married couple filing jointly) or less than $112,500 if you’re the head of household (typically single parents).
<br><br>
<strong>Even if you have no income,</strong> you’re eligible to receive a stimulus check.
<br><br>
<strong>If you are over the income limit,</strong> you may be eligible for a partial payment.
<br><br>
<strong>You don't have to be a U.S. citizen</strong> to get a stimulus payment, but you do need a valid Social Security number. That means immigrants with green cards and people on H-1B and H-2A visas will get payments. <strong>DACA residents with a valid Social Security number may be eligible for a stimulus payment.</strong> Non-resident aliens, temporary workers, and undocumented immigrants won't receive payments.
<br><br>
Here’s a <a href='https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-a-eip-eligibility-and-general-information' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>list</a> of the people who aren’t eligible for stimulus payments.
<br><br>
If you or someone you know is incarcerated and hasn't filed taxes in 2019 or 2018, you are now eligible for a payment, according to a new court ruling. But you must apply online by November 21 or October 15 by mail.

If you filed your taxes through a tax preparation service, and received an advanced refund, your payment could have been sent to a temporary account set up by the tax preparation service. Others have had their checks sent to closed accounts, based on information the IRS had on file from 2018 tax returns.
<br><br>
If the IRS sent your payment to a temporary or closed account, the bank should reject the payment. The IRS will then send you a check to the address they have on file. If you need to update your address, you can visit <a href='https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc157' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>this IRS link</a>. If you’ve recently moved, be sure that you’ve updated your address with the <a href='https://www.usa.gov/post-office' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>U.S. Postal Service</a>.
<br><br>
To receive your payment more quickly, you can also try to update your direct deposit information with the IRS. The IRS is sending letters to everyone who they have sent payments to, within 15 days of sending the payments. The letters will have instructions for how to provide the IRS with the correct information. We'll also be updating this site with other instructions as they become available.
