<p><strong>The vast majority of Michigan residents are eligible</strong> for the coronavirus stimulus payment.
<br><br>
<strong>To qualify for the full payment,</strong> you must make less than $75,000 per year ($150,000 for a married couple filing jointly) or less than $112,500 if you’re the head of household (typically single parents).
<br><br>
<strong>Even if you have no income,</strong> you’re eligible to receive a stimulus check.
<br><br>
<strong>If you are over the income limit,</strong> you may be eligible for a partial payment.
<br><br>
<strong>You don't have to be a U.S. citizen</strong> to get a stimulus payment, but you do need a valid Social Security number. That means immigrants with green cards and people on H-1B and H-2A visas will get payments. <strong>DACA residents with a valid Social Security number may be eligible for a stimulus payment.</strong> Non-resident aliens, temporary workers, and undocumented immigrants won't receive payments.
