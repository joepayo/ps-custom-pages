<p><strong>All dependents, even those over 17, will be eligible for the new round of stimulus payments, though all funds will go to the parent taxpayer.</strong> This is a change from the first two round of payments, in which those 17 who qualified as dependents were not eligible for payments, either for themselves or for their parents.

Generally, students who are under 24, receive significant financial support from their parents, and attend school full-time are considered dependents by the IRS.
<br><br>
Students who are over 19, in school part time, largely supporting themselves, or not living with their parents, are likely to have independent status, and therefore qualify for the payments themselves.
<br><br>
It should also be noted that recent college graduates (e.g., graduated in 2020), who may have been listed as a dependent in 2019, should file their 2020 taxes to potentially be eligible for the latest round of payments.</p>
