<p>In order to receive your stimulus check, you now have to file your taxes. For the first two payments, those who were not required to file taxes because of low earnings could enter their information through a portal on the IRS website. That portal is now closed. If you did not file taxes in 2018 or 2019, or if you did not use the IRS payment portal for the first two checks, you need to file taxes in 2020 in order to receive your stimulus check. You can get started using the <a href='https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IRS Free File</a> program.

It’s possible that the IRS will relaunch their payment info portal for the third round of checks, and if that happens we will update this site.</p>
