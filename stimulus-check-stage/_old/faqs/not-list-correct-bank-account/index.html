<p>There are a number of reasons this could happen. If you filed your taxes through a tax preparation service, and received an advanced refund, your payment could have been sent to a temporary account set up by the tax preparation service. Others have had their checks sent to closed accounts, based on information the IRS had on file from prior tax returns.
<br><br>
If the IRS sent your payment to a temporary or closed account, the bank should reject the payment. The IRS will then send you a check to the address they have on file. If you need to update your address, you can visit <a href='https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc157' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>this IRS link</a>. If you’ve recently moved, be sure that you’ve updated your address with the <a href='https://www.usa.gov/post-office' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>U.S. Postal Service</a>.
<br><br>
To receive your payment more quickly, you can also try to update your direct deposit information with the IRS. The IRS is sending letters to everyone who they have sent payments to, within 15 days of sending the payments. The letters will have instructions for how to provide the IRS with the correct information. We'll also be updating this site with other instructions as they become available.

<em>Note:</em> If you receive other benefits on a prepaid debit card, be sure to check and see if the payment was sent to this card.

<em>Note:</em> If you did not receive either payment, or the full amount of each payment, but believe you are eligible, you can claim the <a href='https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/recovery-rebate-credit' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Recovery Rebate Credit</a> to receive a refund or credit on your <a href='https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>2020 taxes</a>, equal to the value of the stimulus payments.</p>
