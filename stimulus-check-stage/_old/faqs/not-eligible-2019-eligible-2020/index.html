<p><strong>If you file your taxes soon, the IRS may be able to use your 2020 tax information to determine your eligibility.</strong> However, even if they do not, supplementary payments will be issued through September of 2021 for households that fall into this scenario. If you don’t receive a supplementary payment, you will also be able to claim the payment amount as a credit on your 2021 taxes.</p>
