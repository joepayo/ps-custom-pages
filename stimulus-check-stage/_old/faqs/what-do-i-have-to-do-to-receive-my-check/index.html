<p>Many do not have to do anything to receive their check. Eligibility for the first two payments was determined based on 2018 or 2019 tax returns. If the IRS had your bank information, payments were wired directly to your bank account. If not, they were mailed to you.

The new round of checks will be based on your 2019 or 2020 tax returns, and again will be issued by direct deposit if the IRS has your bank information, or by mail. Some individuals will also receive their payments through a pre-paid Economic Impact Payment Card (EIP Card).
If you did not file taxes in 2019, but used the IRS Non-Filers tool in 2020 in order to receive your first two stimulus checks, the IRS should have enough information to send your third check.</p>
