Non-customers can cash stimulus checks for free at Chase banks, with two forms of identification. Find the approved ‘forms of identification’ list <a href="https://detroitmi.gov/media/36006" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, note that one form of ID must be from the primary ID column. Free check cashing will only apply to government stimulus checks.
