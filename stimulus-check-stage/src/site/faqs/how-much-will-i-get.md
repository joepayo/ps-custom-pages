**If you didn’t receive a payment in the spring and you qualify for the stimulus payment,** you’ll receive up to $1,200 for yourself ($2,400 if married and filing jointly). You’ll receive an additional $500 for every dependent child under the age of 17.

The second stimulus payment is $600 for an individual and $1,200 for a married couple with no payments for dependents.

**If you’re over the income limit,** you may be eligible for a partial payment.
