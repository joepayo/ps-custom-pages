We've heard reports that some individuals are not receiving the dependent payments they are eligible for. If you receive Social Security retirement benefits or SSI, and have dependents, it's possible the IRS sent out your payment without accounting for your dependents. For others, it's unclear why you wouldn't be receiving the full amount you are eligible for. In both cases, you will have to wait to receive a letter for the IRS, and then follow instructions on how to provide the IRS with the correct information. For those who receive Social Security or SSI, you can also try to enter information on your dependents on the <a href='https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IRS site for non-filers</a>, though if the payment has already been made the site may not let you enter this information.
