**The vast majority of Michigan residents are eligible** for the coronavirus stimulus payment. 
<br><br>
**To qualify for the full payment,** you must make less than $75,000 per year ($150,000 for a married couple filing jointly) or less than $112,500 if you’re the head of household (typically single parents).
<br><br>
**Even if you have no income,** you’re eligible to receive a stimulus check. 
<br><br>
**If you are over the income limit,** you may be eligible for a partial payment.
<br><br>
**You don't have to be a U.S. citizen** to get a stimulus payment, but you do need a valid Social Security number. That means immigrants with green cards and people on H-1B and H-2A visas will get payments. **DACA residents with a valid Social Security number may be eligible for a stimulus payment.** Non-resident aliens, temporary workers, and undocumented immigrants won't receive payments.

If you or someone you know is incarcerated and hasn't filed taxes in 2019 or 2018, you are now eligible for a payment, according to a new court ruling. But you must apply online by November 21 or October 15 by mail.
