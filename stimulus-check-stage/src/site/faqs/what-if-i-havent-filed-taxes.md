**You must file taxes to receive a stimulus check,** unless you are receiving Social Security benefits. The federal government will use tax returns (from 2018 or 2019) to determine if you’re eligible for a stimulus payment and how much money you’re eligible for. If you’re required to file taxes, but did not file in 2018 or 2019, find free filing options on the <a href='https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>IRS Free File site</a>.

**If you’re not required to file taxes,** or if your income is under $12,200 ($24,000 for a married couple filing jointly), you still need to enter your payment information on the <a href='https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IRS website</a> to receive your stimulus payment. **Even if you have no income, you need to enter your information on the IRS site.**
