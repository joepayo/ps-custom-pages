**No, the stimulus payments will not impact your other benefits.** The stimulus checks are treated as a tax credit. This means your payment will not impact the benefits you receive now or in the future.

For example, the stimulus payment won’t impact your food stamps, healthcare, earned income tax credit, or unemployment benefits.
