You may still be eligible to receive a payment in 2021 if:
<br>
* You did not register online, by mail and did not get a payment in 2020 or,
* You received a payment, but it wasn’t the full amount of the Economic Impact Payment. The maximum credit is $1,200, or $2,400 if married filing jointly, plus $500 for each qualifying child.
