Payments for the second round of Stimulus payments began the last week of December and will continue through the month of January 2021.  People with direct deposit will receive their payments first.  Other payments will follow due to longer processing and mailing times.  The IRS will <a href='https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/second-eip-faqs' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>post updates</a> as more information becomes available.
