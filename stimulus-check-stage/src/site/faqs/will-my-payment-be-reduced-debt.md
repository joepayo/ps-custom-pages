**No, your stimulus payment will not be offset by government debts,** including federal student loan debts. 
<br><br>
However, **if you owe child support payments** that have been reported to the U.S. Treasury Department your payments may be decreased. If this is the case, you should have received a letter from the U.S. Treasury Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Contact Michigan Child Support for more information: (877) 543-2660.
