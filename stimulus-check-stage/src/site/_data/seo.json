  "meta": "The vast majority of Michigan residents are eligible to receive a stimulus check from the federal government this year. Even if you have no income, you are still eligible, but need to file taxes to receive your stimulus payment. <strong>This includes individuals with low or no earnings who normally don't file taxes.</strong> You could receive up to $1,200 for yourself ($2,400 for a married couple) and an additional $500 for each dependent child. This site will take you through the process step by step so you can get your payment as soon as possible.",
