title: If you haven't filed taxes, even if you have no income, don’t miss out
text: If you are not required to file taxes, or if your income is under $12,200 ($24,400 for a married couple), you need to enter your payment information on the <a href='https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IRS website</a> by November 21 to get your stimulus payment. <strong>Even if you have no income, you are still eligible, and need to enter your information through <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this portal</a>.</strong> If you are required to file taxes but did not file in 2018 or 2019, you can find free filing options through the IRS <a href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Free File Site</a> or <a href="https://www.myfreetaxes.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">United Way's MyFreeTaxes</a>, or Accounting Aid Society’s virtual <a href="https://accountingaidsociety.org/vita-ace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VITA ACE</a> program.
