title: What if your bank account or address changed since spring?
text: If you received a stimulus payment in spring and your bank account or address has changed, your payment will be returned to the IRS and will have to wait until you file your 2020 taxes to get your money.  On your 1040 or 1040-SR you will need to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit.<br><br>If you do not normally file taxes, you will need to do so to get your second payment if your banking or address changed after receiving your first payment.<br><br>File your taxes as soon as possible to get your payment faster! (Should we have a link to free tax prep services).
