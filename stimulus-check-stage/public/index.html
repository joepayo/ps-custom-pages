        <p class="text-2xl leading-tight">As of the end of February 2021, the federal government had distributed two payments to eligible families to help during the economic crisis caused by COVID-19. In early March of 2021, Congress passed a third relief package, which included more relief payments (often referred to as stimulus checks, Economic Impact Payments, or Recovery Rebates). This site will help you understand if you will receive or should have received any of these payments, and provide guidance on what you should do to receive the funding you are eligible for.</p>

        <p class="mb-6 text-2xl leading-tight md:w-1/2 lg:w-2/5 fade-in-left animated">The vast majority of Michigan residents should have already received the first two stimulus payments, and are eligible to receive the third check issued in early March. Every American adult earning less than $75,000 (or couples earning less than $150,000, or single head of household earning less than $112,500) is eligible for the full amount of each stimulus payment.</p>

          <div class="invisible h-0 pb-4 opacity-0 text-11875 markdown max-h-0">
            <p>The payment amounts are all slightly different:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the first stimulus payment (issued in March of 2020), eligible individuals should have received $1,200 ($2,400 if married and filing jointly), with an additional $500 for every dependent under 17.</li>
<li>For the second stimulus payment, households that meet the income requirement should have received $600 for every adult and dependent child under 17.</li>
<li>For the third stimulus payment, eligible individuals will receive $1,400 ($2,800 if married and filing jointly), plus $1,400 for each claimed dependent, including those that are 17 and over (e.g., college students who are still claimed as dependents, as well as older adults who may live with you and are claimed as dependents).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the size of the check and expanded eligibility for dependents, the biggest difference with the third payment is the eligibility for partial payments. For the first two checks income eligibility for partial payments extended well above $75,000, but for the third payments, adults earning more than $80,000 (or married couples earning more than $160,000) will not receive checks.</p>

If you did not file taxes in 2019, but used the IRS Non-Filers tool in 2020 in order to receive your first two stimulus checks, the IRS should have enough information to send your third check.</p>

If you did not file taxes in 2018 or 2019, or if you did not use the IRS payment portal for the first two checks, you need to file taxes in 2020 in order to receive your stimulus check.

<br><br>
Generally, students who are under 24, receive significant financial support from their parents, and attend school full-time are considered dependents by the IRS.
<br><br>
Students who are over 19, in school part time, largely supporting themselves, or not living with their parents, are likely to have independent status, and therefore qualify for the payments themselves.
<br><br>
It should also be noted that recent college graduates (e.g., graduated in 2020), who may have been listed as a dependent in 2019, should file their 2020 taxes to potentially be eligible for the latest round of payments.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="invisible h-0 text-2xl opacity-0 answer markdown max-h-0"><p>There are a number of reasons this could happen. If you filed your taxes through a tax preparation service, and received an advanced refund, your payment could have been sent to a temporary account set up by the tax preparation service. Others have had their checks sent to closed accounts, based on information the IRS had on file from prior tax returns.
<br><br>
If the IRS sent your payment to a temporary or closed account, the bank should reject the payment. The IRS will then send you a check to the address they have on file. If you need to update your address, you can visit <a href='https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc157' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>this IRS link</a>. If you’ve recently moved, be sure that you’ve updated your address with the <a href='https://www.usa.gov/post-office' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>U.S. Postal Service</a>.
<br><br>
To receive your payment more quickly, you can also try to update your direct deposit information with the IRS. The IRS is sending letters to everyone who they have sent payments to, within 15 days of sending the payments. The letters will have instructions for how to provide the IRS with the correct information. We'll also be updating this site with other instructions as they become available.
