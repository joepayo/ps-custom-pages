<p>Your information may not appear on the <a href='https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Get My Payment</a> site if you didn't file your taxes in 2018 or 2019, if you recently filed taxes and they haven't been processed yet, if you recently entered payment information on the <a href='https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>IRS site for non-filers</a>, or if you receive Social Security benefits. You may also get this message if you are not eligible for a payment. Here is <a href='https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment-frequently-asked-questions#elig' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>a list</a> of the people who aren’t eligible for stimulus payments.
<br><br>
If you haven't filed taxes, you must either file taxes, or, if you aren't required to file, enter your payment information on the IRS site for non-filers.  If you've recently filed your taxes, or entered your payment information, check back once per day on the <a href='https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Get My Payment</a> site to see if it's been processed. If you receive Social Security benefits, it's likely the IRS has already sent your payment to the same account you receive your benefits.

<em>Note:</em> If you did not receive either payment, or the full amount of each payment, but believe you are eligible, you can claim the <a href='https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/recovery-rebate-credit' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>Recovery Rebate Credit</a> to receive a refund or credit on your <a href='https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer noopener'>2020 taxes</a>, equal to the value of the stimulus payments.</p>
