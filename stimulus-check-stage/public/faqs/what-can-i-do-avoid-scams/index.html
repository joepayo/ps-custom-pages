<p>The IRS urges taxpayers to be on the lookout for scam artists trying to use the stimulus payments as cover for schemes to steal personal information and money.
<br><br>
<strong>The IRS will not call you, text you, email you, or contact you on social media asking for personal or bank account information</strong> - even related to the stimulus payments.
<br><br>
<strong>Watch out for emails with attachments or links</strong> claiming to have special information about stimulus payments or refunds.</p>
